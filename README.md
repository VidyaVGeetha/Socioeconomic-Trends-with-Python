# 📊 Chicago Socioeconomic Data Analysis using Python & SQLite

Welcome to my data analysis project using real-world data from the [City of Chicago Open Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/). This project demonstrates my skills in data wrangling, SQL integration, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization — all essential for a career in **data analysis**.

## 📁 Dataset Information

- **Source**: [Chicago Socioeconomic Indicators](https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/jcxq-k9xf.csv)
- **Description**: Contains demographic and socioeconomic indicators for 77 community areas in Chicago.
- **Key Fields**:
  - Community Area Name & Number
  - Per Capita Income
  - Poverty Rate
  - Unemployment
  - Hardship Index

---

## 💻 Tools & Technologies

- `Python`
- `pandas` & `NumPy`
- `SQLite3`
- `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn`
- `PrettyTable` (for terminal display)

---

## 🔍 Project Goals

- Import and clean real-world CSV data
- Load and query the data using SQLite
- Analyze socioeconomic disparities across communities
- Visualize relationships (e.g., between Per Capita Income and Hardship Index)
- Generate insights that could support urban policy decisions

---

## 📈 Key Insight

> Communities with a **higher Hardship Index** tend to have a **lower Per Capita Income** — highlighting economic disparities within the city.

---

## 📊 Sample Visualization

> Scatter plot showing the inverse relationship between `Per Capita Income` and `Hardship Index`.

(*Will be added in future update or available in notebook screenshots*)
